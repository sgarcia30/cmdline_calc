# Node Command Line Calculator

## Overview

This tool allows users to input a math expression (in quotes) into their command line and receive the calculated answer as an output on the command line.
I chose to use Node.js to implement this tool because it's a language I know and I wanted the opportunity to try out some other new concepts for this project (i.e. the Shunting Yard Algorithm, Reverse Polish Notation, & Stack Data Structure).
While building this tool I had to work through coming up with various regular expressions to parse out the math expression.  Another area that was challenging was determining how to evaluate the math expression pieces as I worked through the parsed expression.
